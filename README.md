Contract source code for the kirsh NFT picture in history
on an Ethereum Virtual Machine-like network whose binary
data is entirely published on chain.

Besides this work being a love gesture, it also proves how currently
virtually all NFT publishing platforms on the market
scam their users in that they meaninglessly make them issue nothing but
useless pointers to resources which will likely be lost
way before the peer-to-peer networks the non-fungible tokens they
are attached to will.

Deployment of this contract is published at address

`0xC8a8A924b80433EB5FF8902B4c7da8429C97714F`

on the Gnosis network.

Without downloading that blockchain it can be read,
same as the picture attached to it,
using a third party network explorer application such as
[Gnosisscan](
  https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xc8a8a924b80433eb5ff8902b4c7da8429c97714f).

Sources are released under the terms of the
[GNU Affero General Public License v3](

a copy of which is provided in this repository
as required by law.

Love and Peace.

May Justice prevail some day, whatever it may mean.
